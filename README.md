# Warehouse-Genetic-Algorithm

The second task from the Mathematical Modelling course I take is to solve the problem from HiMCM: The High School Mathematical Contest in Modeling Problem B. The problem asked us to model the number and location of warehouses so that the shipping duration is one day for all across USA, according to the shipping duration maps provided by the official website of UPS. We tried recreating the solution Team 2711 offered, though some changes and alteration are made to fit the data currently provided. Genetic algorithm is an algorithm that reflects the process of natural selection where suitable individuals are chosen for reproduction to produce offspring from the next generation. Our team is able to find the best solution by genetic algorithm using the programming language Python.
